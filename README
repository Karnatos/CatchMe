This PvP plugin allows you to define a WorldGuard region as a catching area.
A catching area is a region where two or more enemy groups (from Permissions) can try to capture it.
If a group stands alone for a configurable time, it will capture it.
Each player of this group will earn money (iConomy) at each determined period because of this capture.

- The Catching Area

It is defined by:
* duration : number of periods (default value: 12)
* period : delay in seconds before earning money (default value: 900)
* time-catch : delay in seconds before capturing the area (default value: 30)
* money-amount : money earned (default value: 5)
 
To define it, edit 'WorldGuard/worlds/your-world/regions.yml' (replace 'your-world' by your current world name).
* In 'flags' add the following parameters: 
  * catching-area: allow (REQUIRED)
  * catching-duration: X
  * catching-period: X
  * catching-time-catch: X
  * catching-money-amount: X
  X is a positive integer value (more than 0).
  If you don't specify one of theses flags, the default value will be used.

* Example:
regions:
  myWorldEditRegion:
    min: {z: 0.0, y: 0.0, x: 0.0}
    flags: {pvp: deny, tnt: deny, catching-area: allow, catching-period: 10, catching-time-catch: 5}
    catchgroups: [myGroup1, myGroup2]
    max: {z: 40.0, y: 20.0, x: 30.0}
    priority: 0
    type: cuboid
    owners:
      players: [myPlayer]
    members: {}

This region 'myWorldEditRegion' will be a catching area for 12 periods of 10 seconds.
If 'myGroup1' or 'myGroup2' stays in it during 5 seconds (alone), it will capture it.
If during the catching delay, an other allowed group enter the area, catching is cancelled.
An other allowed group can capture it at any time.


- The Lang file

You can redefine all ingame messages.
To do that, create path '/catchme/lang/' (if not exists) in directory 'plugin'.
Then, create file 'lang.yml'. Now you have 'MyMinecraftServer/plugin/catchme/lang/lang.yml'

Copy/Paste the following code (here are default values).

lang:
  receive-money: You receive
  now-controls: now controls
  from: from
  enter-catchzone: You enter the catchzone
  controlled-by: controlled by

You don't have to specify all lines, just the ones you want to change the default text.

Then, you just have to replace the sample text by whatever you want.


IMPORTANT : All file modifications need a reboot to be taken in count.
