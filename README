-----------------------------------------

This is a PvP plugin in which you have to gain control of an area !

If your group controls an area, you will be periodically reward with money.
But, be careful ! Any other group can steel this area from you.

In details, you or one of your group's mate can stand in an area defined as a WorldGuard region.
If alone during a few time in the region, your group will be known as controlling this area and will periodically earn money in the iConomy system.

Let one enemy enter during the catpure phase and it will be cancelled.
Also, the area will automatically be neutral after a fixed duration.

Most datas are configurable.

*********************
* The Catching Area *
*********************

- How to define it ? 

A catching area is defined with 'flags':

* duration : number of periods before becoming neutral(default value: 12)
* period : delay in seconds between each earn money (default value: 900)
* time-catch : delay in seconds before capturing the area (default value: 30)
* money-amount : money earned after each period (default value: 5)

And 'catchgroups' which will be the only groups allowed to capture the area.

You can define it  with ingame commands or manually.

* In-game commands *

To define it, just open the chat and write : '/cm addarea myarea'

You'll have to set groups with : '/cm addgroup myarea mygroup1' '/cm addgroup myarea mygroup2' (groups must exist !)

And if you want to change default options : '/cm flag catching-<flag> X' (see flags in the next part)

* Editing config file *
 
To define it, edit 'catchme/worlds/your-world/regions.yml' (replace 'your-world' by your current world name), or create it if it doesn't exist.
The file is structured as follows :
regions:
  myWorldGuardRegion1:
    flags: {catching-area: Y, catching-duration: X, catching-period: X, catching-time-catch: X, catching-money-amount: X}
    catchgroups: [myGroup1, myGroup2]
  myWorldGuardRegion2:
    flags: {catching-area: Y, catching-duration: X, catching-period: X, catching-time-catch: X, catching-money-amount: X}
    catchgroups: [myGroup1, myGroup3, myGroup4]

Y is 'allow' or 'deny'
X is a positive integer value.
If you don't specify one of theses flags, the default value will be used.

For 'catching-duration', if you use 0 as value, the duration will be infinite.

* Example:
regions:
  totoReg:
    flags: {catching-area: allow, catching-period: 10, catching-time-catch: 5}
    catchgroups: [myGroup1, myGroup2]
  titi:
    flags: {catching-area: deny, catching-duration: 30}

In this example, the region 'totoReg' will be an enabled catching area with these caracteristics :
duration: 12 periods (default)
period: 10 seconds
time-catch: 5 seconds
money-amount: 5 (default)

The region 'titi' will not be a catching area because of 'catching-area: deny'.

By default, a WorldGuard region not explicitly tagged (in CatchMe regions file) with 'catching-area: allow' will be considered as 'deny'

*****************
* The Lang file *
*****************

You can redefine all ingame messages.
To do that, create path '/catchme/lang/' (if not exists) in directory 'plugin'.
Then, create file 'lang.yml'. Now you have 'MyMinecraftServer/plugin/catchme/lang/lang.yml'

Copy/Paste the following code (here are default values).

lang:
  receive-money: You receive
  now-controls: now controls
  from: from
  enter-catchzone: You enter the catchzone
  controlled-by: controlled by

You don't have to specify all lines, just the ones you want to change the default text.

Then, you just have to replace the sample text by whatever you want.
